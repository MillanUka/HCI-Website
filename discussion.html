          From our research we found several problems with the application. We
          have discovered several recommendations that would improve the My diet
          application
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the major features that had several issues was the "Find Food
          Record" feature. Most of the participants described This the worst
          feature of the application. This feature is intended to allow the user
          to search for food from the database, in which the user can then add
          to their daily diet record. An issue that all our participants
          encountered was the multitude of results that received when they
          searched for a specific item. For example, when participant 1 tried
          searching for eggs they got many results for meals with eggs. However,
          they found it difficult to find a "normal egg". This issue is caused
          because the search is a pure text search. Combining a text search with
          other search criteria may give more relevant results. One extra
          criteria that we recommend to implement is a relevance evaulation
          engine. A evaluation engine could use several different scoring
          metrics, such as a rank or scale. This metric could be given to a food
          item based on several criteria, this could be based on the user's
          previous items, the number of times the item has been clicked on,
          items that similar users entered into their daily records, etc. This
          would allow the user to get more relevant results. Another solution
          could be to add a filter, which could filter by category, or other
          criteria, this would allow the user to narrow down their search.
        </p>
        <p>
          There also UI/UX issues with the search feature. Participant 2 said
          that they would prefer a simpler search, they also did not notice the
          categories. Participant 2 also said that they did not want to have the
          nutritional information as the first screen, when they click on a
          search result. Participant 1 also stated that the text on search, did
          not seem clickable. This clearly demonstrates confusion with the UI/UX
          design of the search feature. The users provided their own suggestion
          such as adding images for the category, we recommend that developers
          take on this suggestion. We also recommend that the text in search
          screen is made more distinguishable, so that the user knows that they
          can interact with the buttons.
