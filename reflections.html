      I am currently completing a Bachelor of Engineering Technology degree majoring in Computer and Mobile Systems
      Engineering. This assignment was insightful because the topics and techniques that I have learnt will be benefitical 
      to me when I step into the workforce as a software developer. With the knowledge that I have learnt about conducting
      usability tests, I will be able to think ahead and implement what I have learnt when I complete a project and deploy
      my project to gain further insight of what I can improve in my applicaiton. This would have been particularly useful
      during my Software Development Practice (SDP) course when I completed my Android application as we could have done a
      usability study to gain feedback from participants to further improve our features. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For this assignment, I have worked on researching various usability tests from articles that conducted a usability study
      on a particular technology. Through the information that I have gathered, I proceeded to create a procedure that will enable
      us to observe the behavior of our participants and conduct our usbability study. Our study and procedure is mainly based  off 
      a paper from Phil Carter. With the help of Robert, I was able to fix my initial procedure that has redundant techniques that 
      I wanted to use such as using a questionaire to collect quantative data. As mentioned in the Methodology page, according to the study 
      by Norgaard M. Hornbaek K. (2006), that some cases of using the think aloud testing method might not get sufficiently analyzed due to the fast-paced nature that 
      this testing method has. I presented this issue with my team member, Millan, and we found that session recording and screen recording
      are commonly used when re-evaluating data collected from the participant. By using these recording methods, we were able to further 
      analyse the participants behavior and the reasonings to the issue they faced while using the application. We analysed our data by observing
      the participant through several behaviours such as whether the participant was confused about a feature, disliked a feature, or liked a feature.
      To ensure we collect sufficient amount of data, we asked the participant further questions to clarify what they don't like about the application, 
      what feature they liked about the application, and what is their overall impression of the application. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were to conduct our usability study again, I would like to have a data table setup to record our data and analyse our data with. The rows in the 
      data table be the features in the application and the coloumns would be the behaviour of the participant and the problem with the feature so 
      that we can easily analyse the data between participants. I would also prefer to conduct our usability study face-to-face with our participants which 
      will allow us to provide the participant with a phone to ensure that our data is consistant. This can eliminate any changes in the GUI that 
      has been made to different device OS and models.

      I am currently in my last year of a Bachelor of Computer and information Science degree majoring in Software Development. This assignment 
      taught many things about HCI principles and conducting and performing research on an application. The skills and knowledge that I have gained 
      from this assignment. As a Software Developer major, most of the papers that I have done, were to do with creating some sort of application, whether it  
      be a web, desktop, or mobile application. Something that isn't discussed a lot during these papers is user-based tests. Most testing in my previous papers 
      were unit testing and acceptance testing. So, this was a new experience for me. I have also written several academic style papers for other courses. This 
      type of assessment was different, as most of the research done in other courses are quantitative rather qualitive. So, it was quite different collecting contextual qualitive data, rather 
      than quantitative data. This was good learning experience that challenged by presumptions on researching HCI.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a couple roles in this project. My main role was as the main moderator for the usability test. In this role I would communicate with the participants, including
      asking them questions, getting clarification on answer, etc. I also contributed to designing the methodology for the assignment. initially when we proposed a methodology 
      we wanted to do a questionnaire; this was a common traditional study method. However, when we communicated with our lecturer, Robert, he told us that a questionnaire, may not be 
      the best method to use for the assignment. He recommended that we read a paper from Phil Carter, called "Liberating usability Testing", in which he described a usability testing as well
      as providing a critique of traditional study methods such as questionnaires and interviews. This paper changed by perceptions of studying user interactions with devices. Previously I thought
      that a questionnaire would be a good way to determine issues with an application. However, after reading Carter's paper I found that a questionnaire does not account for many different factors. A questionnaire
      is good for validating the moderator's presumption, however it can miss a lot of information, that is covered by usability testing. This challenged by pre-defined presumptions on questionnaires. I will
      now be more reluctant to use a questionnaire as the first choice for testing HCI. Regarding usability testing, I learned a lot about conducting a usability test. As I did more usability tests, I became more comfortable
      conducting these tests and started picking up on more of the nonverbal cues that the participants expressed. I have also gained skills on designing study methodologies for research study. This is important in the industry or academia. 
      Where I could use these skills to design tests and collect data to improve applications,
    </p>
    <p>
      There would be several things that I would change if I were to do this assignment again. One would be to do more research on the various study methodologies. A lot of our inspiration for the study methodology
      was from one paper, "Liberating Usability Testing". This paper was only intended to give general information about usability testing. I would have liked to look more into specialist research that was done on mobile applications. 
      This would have allowed us to develop better moderator guidelines for conducting usability tests for mobile applications. I felt I also may have made some minor mistakes with conducting the usability tests. Such as asking questions in 
      a way that may have influenced the participant's answer. We also gave them some tasks at the rear of the Usability tests. This may have violated some of the principles of usability testing, which in turn could have affected and contaminated our results.
      However, I think that generally the usability tests were conducted well. I would have also liked to have the usability tests in more of a laboratory environment. All our usability tests were done virtually through Microsoft Teams, this may have impacted the results
      In conclusion, I think generally we have successfully conducted usability tests, and managed to get a lot of issues and information from the MyDiet Application. This information would be useful for the developers as they can make the improvements that have been discussed in this report.
