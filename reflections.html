        <p>
          I am currently completing a Bachelor of Engineering Technology degree
          majoring in Computer and Mobile Systems Engineering. This assignment
          was insightful because the topics and techniques that I have learnt
          will be benefitical to me when I step into the workforce as a software
          developer. With the knowledge that I have learnt about conducting
          usability tests, I will be able to think ahead and implement what I
          have learnt when I complete a project and deploy my project to gain
          further insight of what I can improve in my applicaiton. This would
          have been particularly useful during my Software Development Practice
          (SDP) course when I completed my Android application as we could have
          done a usability study to gain feedback from participants to further
          improve our features.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this assignment, I have worked on researching various usability
          tests from articles that conducted a usability study on a particular
          technology. Through the information that I have gathered, I proceeded
          to create a procedure that will enable us to observe the behavior of
          our participants and conduct our usbability study. Our study and
          procedure is mainly based off a paper from Phil Carter. With the help
          of Robert, I was able to fix my initial procedure that has redundant
          techniques that I wanted to use such as using a questionaire to
          collect quantative data. As mentioned in the Methodology page,
          according to the study by Norgaard M. Hornbaek K. (2006), that some
          cases of using the think aloud testing method might not get
          sufficiently analyzed due to the fast-paced nature that this testing
          method has. I presented this issue with my team member, Millan, and we
          found that session recording and screen recording are commonly used
          when re-evaluating data collected from the participant. By using these
          recording methods, we were able to further analyse the participants
          behavior and the reasonings to the issue they faced while using the
          application. We analysed our data by observing the participant through
          several behaviours such as whether the participant was confused about
          a feature, disliked a feature, or liked a feature. To ensure we
          collect sufficient amount of data, we asked the participant further
          questions to clarify what they don't like about the application, what
          feature they liked about the application, and what is their overall
          impression of the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I were to conduct our usability study again, I would like to have a
          data table setup to record our data and analyse our data with. The
          rows in the data table be the features in the application and the
          coloumns would be the behaviour of the participant and the problem
          with the feature so that we can easily analyse the data between
          participants. I would also prefer to conduct our usability study
          face-to-face with our participants which will allow us to provide the
          participant with a phone to ensure that our data is consistant. This
          can eliminate any changes in the GUI that has been made to different
          device OS and models.

        <p>
          I am in my last year of my Bachelor of Computer and information
          science majoring in Network and Security. It was interesting as the
          concepts learnt this branches away from my area of study which was a
          new experience for myself. From past experiences I could not really
          relate or apply any of my knowledge as this was a new concept and way
          or learning. The study methods were very interesting and taught me how
          we can collected information though a verbal communication, where we
          were able to effectively analyse expressions and other factors
          effecting these decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          My role was to also collect the data from the interviews on the each
          of the participants. I was to analyse and understand why exactly they
          came to that conclusion and compared this to the other 4 participants.
          I find that having a small sample size of only 4 people only limited
          us with a small amount of data, but in this case was sufficient
          enough. I then accumulated each participant’s data and merged only the
          relevant information needed. I found that having a small sample size
          of only 4 people only limited us with a small amount of data. I was
          too produce the discussion and conclusion based on the research and
          data gather from the interviews. I feel that in the networking field
          these skills would be relevant much like creating an app, designing a
          network based on the client’s needs and further development of my
          analysis and communication skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think that next time, more research on study methods would have been
          more beneficial for our study method. I think that we should have had
          more online/in person meetings as I think this would have made
          communication much better. I think next time we would go more in depth
          about the reasoning for their decision they made. Having set
          instructions when conducting the interview would have made the
          interview flow much better. But I also feel that it was good to let
          the user experience the application and naturally explore it
          themselves. I think that for the first time conducting usability tests
          it was a good experience for myself as I now have a good insight of
          how I can apply this in the near future.

        <p>
          I am a student at Auckland University of Technology currently
          completing a Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences, majoring
          in Software Development. Conducting this study gave me insight and
          direct experience into the processes of conducting usability tests. It
          has given me the tools and knowledge to be able to implement user
          testing for my future endeavours in software development. In future
          when I am developing software I feel that I will be more effective in
          designing products in a way to maximise the success of usability test
          outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked on conducting user testing interviews with participants.
          Users interacted with applications in vastly different ways and had
          various opinions on different things, so the structure and pace of
          interviews was unpredictable. I have learned the importance of the
          interviewing skill to extract the relevant information from test
          participants. I also learned the importance of facilitating the
          interview in such a way to let the user have freedom to explore the
          interface. The interviewer needs to be very careful with their choice
          of words and questions asked during the test as this can very easily
          create external influences to particpants, which would not preferable
          during our study, which implemented a cognitive walkthrough.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also conducted research on usability testing methodologies, in
          particular heuristic testing approaches. From this I have learned
          about standard practices in heuristic testing and also the founding
          theories behind usability testing. A crucial theory I had learned was
          the CE+ model, which breaks down the process of what a user thinks,
          how that informs their decision to interact with the interface and
          then how they respond to the feedback the interface provides. Learning
          about the theory has cemented the universal goal in creating
          interfaces, which is to design a system that allows users to learn how
          to use the interface with minimum learning support. My research has
          also taught me the importance and value of qualitative data in
          usability testing. Through my research I had also come across
          different implementations of user testing that I can consider for
          future software development work, such as testing at different types
          of the day, providing users with specific instructions during the
          test, asking specific interview questions and identifying key words
          when analysing qualitative data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that I have completed my first usability study, in future I would
          take more time and insight to prepare for interview questions and
          provide better instructions to users when conducting interviews, given
          that I've seen the range of ways that users participate in the study.
          This would allow for us to collect more insightful data and capture
          significant information more effectively and draw out things that the
          user is thinking but did not say out loud.

        <h3>Millan Uka</h3>
        <p>
          I am currently in my last year of a Bachelor of Computer and
          information Science degree majoring in Software Development. This
          assignment taught many things about HCI principles and conducting and
          performing research on an application. The skills and knowledge that I
          have gained from this assignment. As a Software Developer major, most
          of the papers that I have done, were to do with creating some sort of
          application, whether it be a web, desktop, or mobile application.
          Something that isn't discussed a lot during these papers is user-based
          tests. Most testing in my previous papers were unit testing and
          acceptance testing. So, this was a new experience for me. I have also
          written several academic style papers for other courses. This type of
          assessment was different, as most of the research done in other
          courses are quantitative rather qualitive. So, it was quite different
          collecting contextual qualitive data, rather than quantitative data.
          This was good learning experience that challenged by presumptions on
          researching HCI.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a couple roles in this project. My main role was as the main
          moderator for the usability test. In this role I would communicate
          with the participants, including asking them questions, getting
          clarification on answer, etc. I also contributed to designing the
          methodology for the assignment. initially when we proposed a
          methodology we wanted to do a questionnaire; this was a common
          traditional study method. However, when we communicated with our
          lecturer, Robert, he told us that a questionnaire, may not be the best
          method to use for the assignment. He recommended that we read a paper
          from Phil Carter, called "Liberating usability Testing", in which he
          described a usability testing as well as providing a critique of
          traditional study methods such as questionnaires and interviews. This
          paper changed by perceptions of studying user interactions with
          devices. Previously I thought that a questionnaire would be a good way
          to determine issues with an application. However, after reading
          Carter's paper I found that a questionnaire does not account for many
          different factors. A questionnaire is good for validating the
          moderator's presumption, however it can miss a lot of information,
          that is covered by usability testing. This challenged by pre-defined
          presumptions on questionnaires. I will now be more reluctant to use a
          questionnaire as the first choice for testing HCI. Regarding usability
          testing, I learned a lot about conducting a usability test. As I did
          more usability tests, I became more comfortable conducting these tests
          and started picking up on more of the nonverbal cues that the
          participants expressed. I have also gained skills on designing study
          methodologies for research study. This is important in the industry or
          academia. Where I could use these skills to design tests and collect
          data to improve applications,
        </p>
        <p>
          There would be several things that I would change if I were to do this
          assignment again. One would be to do more research on the various
          study methodologies. A lot of our inspiration for the study
          methodology was from one paper, "Liberating Usability Testing". This
          paper was only intended to give general information about usability
          testing. I would have liked to look more into specialist research that
          was done on mobile applications. This would have allowed us to develop
          better moderator guidelines for conducting usability tests for mobile
          applications. I felt I also may have made some minor mistakes with
          conducting the usability tests. Such as asking questions in a way that
          may have influenced the participant's answer. We also gave them some
          tasks at the rear of the Usability tests. This may have violated some
          of the principles of usability testing, which in turn could have
          affected and contaminated our results. However, I think that generally
          the usability tests were conducted well. I would have also liked to
          have the usability tests in more of a laboratory environment. All our
          usability tests were done virtually through Microsoft Teams, this may
          have impacted the results In conclusion, I think generally we have
          successfully conducted usability tests, and managed to get a lot of
          issues and information from the MyDiet Application. This information
          would be useful for the developers as they can make the improvements
          that have been discussed in this report.
