      I am currently completing a Bachelor of Engineering Technology degree majoring in Computer and Mobile Systems
      Engineering. This assignment was insightful because the topics and techniques that I have learnt will be benefitical 
      to me when I step into the workforce as a software developer. With the knowledge that I have learnt about conducting
      usability tests, I will be able to think ahead and implement what I have learnt when I complete a project and deploy
      my project to gain further insight of what I can improve in my applicaiton. This would have been particularly useful
      during my Software Development Practice (SDP) course when I completed my Android application as we could have done a
      usability study to gain feedback from participants to further improve our features. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For this assignment, I have worked on researching various usability tests from articles that conducted a usability study
      on a particular technology. Through the information that I have gathered, I proceeded to create a procedure that will enable
      us to observe the behavior of our participants and conduct our usbability study. Our study and procedure is mainly based  off 
      a paper from Phil Carter. With the help of Robert, I was able to fix my initial procedure that has redundant techniques that 
      I wanted to use such as using a questionaire to collect quantative data. As mentioned in the Methodology page, according to the study 
      by Norgaard M. Hornbaek K. (2006), that some cases of using the think aloud testing method might not get sufficiently analyzed due to the fast-paced nature that 
      this testing method has. I presented this issue with my team member, Millan, and we found that session recording and screen recording
      are commonly used when re-evaluating data collected from the participant. By using these recording methods, we were able to further 
      analyse the participants behavior and the reasonings to the issue they faced while using the application. We analysed our data by observing
      the participant through several behaviours such as whether the participant was confused about a feature, disliked a feature, or liked a feature.
      To ensure we collect sufficient amount of data, we asked the participant further questions to clarify what they don't like about the application, 
      what feature they liked about the application, and what is their overall impression of the application. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were to conduct our usability study again, I would like to have a data table setup to record our data and analyse our data with. The rows in the 
      data table be the features in the application and the coloumns would be the behaviour of the participant and the problem with the feature so 
      that we can easily analyse the data between participants. I would also prefer to conduct our usability study face-to-face with our participants which 
      will allow us to provide the participant with a phone to ensure that our data is consistant. This can eliminate any changes in the GUI that 
      has been made to different device OS and models.
