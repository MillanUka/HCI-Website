      I am currently completing a Bachelor of Engineering Technology degree majoring in Computer and Mobile Systems
      Engineering. This assignment was insightful because the topics and techniques that I have learnt will be benefitical 
      to me when I step into the workforce as a software developer. With the knowledge that I have learnt about conducting
      usability tests, I will be able to think ahead and implement what I have learnt when I complete a project and deploy
      my project to gain further insight of what I can improve in my applicaiton. This would have been particularly useful
      during my Software Development Practice (SDP) course when I completed my Android application as we could have done a
      usability study to gain feedback from participants to further improve our features. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For this assignment, I have worked on researching various usability tests from articles that conducted a usbability study
      on a particular technology. Through the information that I have gathered, I proceeded to create a procedure that will enable
      us to observe the behavior of our participants and conduct our usbability study. Our study and procedure is mainly based  off 
      a paper from Phil Carter. With the help of Robert, I was able to fix my initial procedure that has redundant techniques that 
      I wanted to use such as using a questionaire to collect quantative data. As mentioned in the Methodology page, according to the study 
      by Norgaard M. Hornbaek K. (2006), that some cases of using the think aloud testing method might not get sufficiently analyzed due to the fast-paced nature that 
      this testing method has. I presented this issue with my team member, Millan, and we found that session recording and screen recording
      are commonly used when re-evaluating data collected from the participant. By using these recording methods, we were able to further 
      analyse the participants behavior and the reasonings to the issue they faced while using the application. We analysed our data by observing
      the participant through several behaviours such as whether the participant was confused about a feature, disliked a feature, or liked a feature.
      To ensure we collect sufficient amount of data, we asked the participant further questions to clarify what they don't like about the application, 
      what feature they liked about the application, and what is their overall impression of the application. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was interesting to learn how a moderator’s behavior and tone can impact a participant’s user experience which also impacts the results of our findings. 
      Conducting a test as a moderator was hard due to the fast-paced nature of taking notes of what the participant was experiencing while still asking 
      questions for further reasonings to a problem and obliging to the rules set for moderators. I believe the experience as a moderator can be further 
      improved if we had additional time to conduct fake tests for moderators to practice such as role-playing. By doing this, I believe moderators will 
      have sufficient experience and understanding of what is to be expected during a real test session.  
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were to conduct our usability study again, I would like to have a data table setup to record our data and analyse our data with. The rows in the 
      data table be the features in the application and the coloumns would be the behaviour of the participant and the problem with the feature so 
      that we can easily analyse the data between participants. I would also prefer to conduct our usability study face-to-face with our participants which 
      will allow us to provide the participant with a phone to ensure that our data is consistant. This can eliminate any changes in the GUI that 
      has been made to different device OS and models.

      I am a student at Auckland University of Technology currently completing a Bachelor of Computer and Information
      Sciences, majoring in Software Development. Conducting this study gave me insight and direct experience into the
      processes of conducting usability tests. It has given me the tools and knowledge to be able to implement user testing
      for my future endeavours in software development. In future when I am developing software I feel that I will be more
      effective in designing products in a way to maximise the success of usability test outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked on conducting user testing interviews with participants. Users interacted with applications in vastly
      different ways and had various opinions on different things, so the structure and pace of interviews was
      unpredictable. I have learned the importance of the interviewing skill to extract the relevant information from test
      participants. I also learned the importance of facilitating the interview in such a way to let the user have freedom
      to explore the interface. The interviewer needs to be very careful with their choice of words and questions asked
      during the test as this can very easily create external influences to particpants, which would not preferable during
      our study, which implemented a cognitive walkthrough.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also conducted research on usability testing methodologies, in particular heuristic testing approaches. From this I
      have learned about standard practices in heuristic testing and also the founding theories behind usability testing. A
      crucial theory I had learned was the CE+ model, which breaks down the process of what a user thinks, how that informs
      their decision to interact with the interface and then how they respond to the feedback the interface provides.
      Learning about the theory has cemented the universal goal in creating interfaces, which is to design a system that
      allows users to learn how to use the interface with minimum learning support. My research has also taught me the
      importance and value of qualitative data in usability testing. Through my research I had also come across different
      implementations of user testing that I can consider for future software development work, such as testing at different
      types of the day, providing users with specific instructions during the test, asking specific interview questions and
      identifying key words when analysing qualitative data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I have completed my first usability study, in future I would take more time and insight to prepare for
      interview questions and provide better instructions to users when conducting interviews, given that I've seen the
      range of ways that users participate in the study. This would allow for us to collect more insightful data and capture
      significant information more effectively and draw out things that the user is thinking but did not say out loud.
