        <h3>Participant 1</h3>
        <p>
          There were several areas that caused confusion for participant 1. When
          searching for a specific product, within the food database, many
          different options would show up. This made it difficult to find a
          specific food item. For example when the participant searched up eggs,
          they got many different meals with eggs in them, such as scrambled
          eggs and McDonald eggs. A normal uncooked egg was called "whole egg",
          which the particpant found confusing, they were unsure if this was
          just a normal egg or not. The participant expressed that this may
          cause users to think that they may need to add the item into the
          database manually, even though the item already exists. The user found
          that this level of detail was confusing and made it hard to plan a
          diet. Another aspect of the search they did not like, was the text was
          very distinguisable from normal text. They thought that the categories
          that showed up, were just normal, and weren't clickable. They would
          like this distingusiable from just normal text, perhaps in button type
          format. Another issue that they had was finding the add button in the
          add record feature. Although the UI generally looks simple, in the add
          food record screen it is complicated. They also confused when adding a
          record into the database. The participant was unsure whether the
          record that they entered was saved to the database or not. They also
          did not know where it was saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were several features of the appilication that the user thought
          were good. The participant like the ability to enter your details such
          as age, height, weight. They thought that this was the best feature of
          the app. They also described the app as "flexible". They felt the app
          was easy to navigate, they liked the simple UI and liked the fact that
          there weren't any crazy colours.
        </p>
        <p>
          The participant also described how they would like certain features to
          be improved. They would like to see that the app be updated to a later
          Android version, as the OS version is currently outdated. In regards
          to the add food record feature, they would like to see a notification
          or some sort of confirmation of there record being saved to the
          database. They would also like to know where it is saved. They would
          like to see the ability to add category to the food record. They
          described the search as the worst feature of the app. Because it was
          difficult to find a specific item. They would like to see this
          improved to give more desirable results.
        </p>
        <p>
          The particpants also reccomended a couple new features to the
          application. The first feature they reccomended was a feature that
          allowed them to get information from nutritionist. Another feature
          would be the ability to share their diet on social media applications.
        </p>
        <h3>Participant 2</h3>
        <p>
          Areas of confusion for participant 2. The first issue they had was
          with the settings page coming up on app start. They felt that this pop
          up was sudden, and that the layout was bad and confusing. The words on
          the tab for the settings are "clustered" making it hard to determine
          which page they were on. They were also confused on why they had to
          input their physical activity. They also found it confusing that for
          the birth date, that you could enter a date pass the current date.
          Which didn't make sense to them. The participant was confused by the
          add record feature, they were confused about this feature, it took
          some time before that understood it to be a feature adds new food
          records to the database. There was also confusion with the search
          feature. There was an add food record button in the top right, the
          participant found this confusing, they were unsure if it was the
          button to add a food record into the diet plan or to add a new food
          record to the database. Within the daily record screen. There was some
          inital confusion about the calendar. They also described the screen as
          clustered. The particpants was also suprised bu the instructions at
          the bottom of the daily diet record page. The participant found that
          the instructions were incorrect. The words were also very technical,
          especially the context menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were several aspects of the app that the particpant like. They
          liked some aspects of the profile settings pages. Within the daily
          diet record screen, they liked that the app displayed the nutrition
          consumed for the day. Within the add food record feature, they liked
          how they could edit the value that you can enter. They liked how you
          could input the specific grams or weight. They described the ability
          to add food record as the best feature of the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were several features that they would like to be improved. They
          would like there to be a description of the add records button. or
          changed to a more descriptive name as they had confusion about it.
          They would of liked there to be a seperate area for food records that
          they had entered. They also suggested that there should be categories.
          Showing that they had no knowledge about the pre-existing categories.
          They suggest that the edit button in the daily record would be next to
          the macro nutrient values rather than being visible after clicking the
          dropdown. They also did not like the search they felt it was too
          clustered. They liked the dropdown, however they would of prefered
          there to be just a title of the food. They also wanted a more simplier search.
          Perhaps have images on the categories. When the participant searched
          up oats, when they clicked on the one of the ooptions, the first thing
          they saw was the nutritional information, they feel this is not
          relevant to them, as they are not too interested in this much detail.
