      <h3>Participant 1</h3>
      <p>
        There were several areas that caused confusion for participant 1. When
        searching for a specific product, within the food database, many
        different options would show up. This made it difficult to find a
        specific food item. For example, when the participant searched up eggs,
        they got many different meals with eggs in them, such as scrambled
        eggs and McDonald eggs. A normal uncooked egg was called "whole egg",
        which the participant found confusing, they were unsure if this was
        just a normal egg or not. The participant expressed that this may
        cause users to think that they may need to add the item into the
        database manually, even though the item already exists. The user found
        that this level of detail was confusing and made it hard to plan a
        diet. Another aspect of the search they did not like, was the text was
        very distinguishable from normal text. They thought that the categories
        that showed up, were just normal, and weren't clickable. They would
        like this distinguishable from just normal text, perhaps in button type
        format. Another issue that they had was finding the add button in the
        add record feature. The UI looks fairly simple. However, in the add
        food record screen it is complicated. They also confused when adding a
        record into the database. The participant was unsure whether the
        record that they entered was saved to the database or not. They also
        did not know where it was saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were several features of the application that the user thought
        were good. The participant like the ability to enter your details such
        as age, height, weight. They thought that this was the best feature of
        the app. They also described the app as "flexible". They felt the app
        was easy to navigate, they liked the simple UI and liked the fact that
        there weren't any crazy colours.
      </p>
      <p>
        The participant also described how they would like certain features to
        be improved. They would like to see that the app be updated to a later
        Android version, as the OS version is currently outdated. In regards
        to the add food record feature, they would like to see a notification
        or some sort of confirmation of their record being saved to the
        database. They would also like to know where it is saved. They would
        like to see the ability to add category to the food record. They
        described the search as the worst feature of the app. Because it was
        difficult to find a specific item. They would like to see this
        improved to give more desirable results.
      </p>
      <p>
        The participants also recommended a couple new features to the
        application. The first feature they recommended was a feature that
        allowed them to get information from nutritionist. Another feature
        would be the ability to share their diet on social media applications.
      </p>
      <h3>Participant 2</h3>
      <p>
        Areas of confusion for participant 2. The first issue they had was
        with the settings page coming up on app start. They felt that this pop
        up was sudden, and that the layout was bad and confusing. The words on
        the tab for the settings were "clustered" making it hard to determine
        which page they were on. They were also confused on why they had to
        input their physical activity. They also found it confusing that for
        the birth date, that you could enter a date pass the current date.
        Which didn't make sense to them. The participant was confused by the
        add record feature, they were confused about this feature, it took
        sometime before that understood it to be a feature adds new food
        records to the database. There was also confusion with the search
        feature. There was an add food record button in the top right, the
        participant found this confusing, they were unsure if it was the
        button to add a food record into the diet plan or to add a new food
        record to the database. Within the daily record screen. There was some
        initial confusion about the calendar. They also described the screen as
        clustered. The participant was also surprised by the instructions at
        the bottom of the daily diet record page. The participant found that
        the instructions were incorrect. The words were also very technical,
        especially the context menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were several aspects of the app that the participant liked. They
        liked some aspects of the profile settings pages. Within the daily
        diet record screen, they liked that the app displayed the nutrition
        consumed for the day. Within the add food record feature, they liked
        how they could edit the value that you can enter. They liked how you
        could input the specific grams or weight. They described the ability
        to add food record as the best feature of the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were several features that they would like to be improved. They
        would like there to be a description of the add records button. or
        changed to a more descriptive name as they had confusion about it.
        They would of liked there to be a separate area for food records that
        they had entered. They also suggested that there should be categories.
        Showing that they had no knowledge about the pre-existing categories.
        They suggest that the edit button in the daily record would be next to
        the macro nutrient values rather than being visible after clicking the
        dropdown. They also did not like the search they felt it was too
        clustered. They liked the dropdown, however they would have preferred
        there to be just a title of the food. They also wanted a simpler search.
        Perhaps have images on the categories. When the participant searched
        up oats, when they clicked on the one of the options, the first thing
        they saw was the nutritional information, they feel this is not
        relevant to them, as they are not too interested in this much detail.
