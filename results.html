      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        This page is to show the results of the study we have conducted with 4 
        participants and display the conclusion of our findings. The study 
        method that we have used is the usability study. We conducted our study 
        with 4 participants where we observe their behavior when they are using 
        the nutrient tracking app, My Diet. Our goal for this study is to identify 
        the pros and cons of the application, the usability of the features in the 
        application, and further improvements that will enhance the usability of
         the application. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The procedure of our study:
        <ol>
          <li>Explain the instructions and the steps to the participant.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This includes ensuring that the participant understands that 
              they have to voice their concerns/confusion throughout the session.</li>
              <li>And that we will ask questions if we observe any unususal facial 
                expression from the participants such as frowning.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Start video and audio recording the session</li>
          <li>Start screen recording of the particpants device</li>
          <li>Have the participant explore the application</li>
          <li>After exploring the app, we will give the participant 3 food items
            to search and enter to their Daily Diet Records.</li>
          <li>Lastly, the researchers will ask questions such as:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>What do you think is the best featre in the app?</li>
            <li>What do you think is the worst featre in the app?</li>
            <li>What is your overall impression of the app?</li>
            <li>What features do you think can be improved on in the app?</li>
          </ul>
          <li>End screen recording</li>
          <li>End session recording</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h3>Participant 1</h3>
      <p>
        There were several areas that caused confusion for participant 1. When
        searching for a specific product, within the food database, many
        different options would show up. This made it difficult to find a
        specific food item. For example, when the participant searched up eggs,
        they got many different meals with eggs in them, such as scrambled
        eggs and McDonald eggs. A normal uncooked egg was called "whole egg",
        which the participant found confusing, they were unsure if this was
        just a normal egg or not. The participant expressed that this may
        cause users to think that they may need to add the item into the
        database manually, even though the item already exists. The user found
        that this level of detail was confusing and made it hard to plan a
        diet. Another aspect of the search they did not like, was the text was
        very distinguishable from normal text. They thought that the categories
        that showed up, were just normal, and weren't clickable. They would
        like this distinguishable from just normal text, perhaps in button type
        format. Another issue that they had was finding the add button in the
        add record feature. The UI looks fairly simple. However, in the add
        food record screen it is complicated. They also confused when adding a
        record into the database. The participant was unsure whether the
        record that they entered was saved to the database or not. They also
        did not know where it was saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were several features of the application that the user thought
        were good. The participant likes the ability to enter your details such
        as age, height, weight. They thought that this was the best feature of
        the app. They also described the app as "flexible". They felt the app
        was easy to navigate, they liked the simple UI and liked the fact that
        there weren't any crazy colours.
      </p>
      <p>
        The participant also described how they would like certain features to
        be improved. They would like to see that the app be updated to a later
        Android version, as the OS version is currently outdated. In regards
        to the add food record feature, they would like to see a notification
        or some sort of confirmation of their record being saved to the
        database. They would also like to know where it was saved. They would
        like to see the ability to add a category to the food record. They
        described the search as the worst feature of the app. Because it was
        difficult to find a specific item. They would like to see this
        improved to give more desirable results.
      </p>
      <p>
        The participants also recommended a couple new features to the
        application. The first feature they recommended was a feature that
        allowed them to get information from nutritionist. Another feature
        would be the ability to share their diet on social media applications.
      </p>
      <h3>Participant 2</h3>
      <p>
        Areas of confusion for participant 2. The first issue they had was
        with the settings page coming up on app start. They felt that this pop
        up was sudden, and that the layout was bad and confusing. The words on
        the tab for the settings were "clustered" making it hard to determine
        which page they were on. They were also confused on why they had to
        input their physical activity. They also found it confusing that for
        the birth date, that you could enter a date pass the current date.
        Which didn't make sense to them. The participant was confused by the
        add record feature, they were confused about this feature, it took
        sometime before that understood it to be a feature adds new food
        records to the database. There was also confusion with the search
        feature. There was an add food record button in the top right, the
        participant found this confusing, they were unsure if it was the
        button to add a food record into the diet plan or to add a new food
        record to the database. Within the daily record screen. There was some
        initial confusion about the calendar. They also described the screen as
        clustered. The participant was also surprised by the instructions at
        the bottom of the daily diet record page. The participant found that
        the instructions were incorrect. The words were also very technical,
        especially the context menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were several aspects of the app that the participant liked. They
        liked some aspects of the profile settings pages. Within the daily
        diet record screen, they liked that the app displayed the nutrition
        consumed for the day. Within the add food record feature, they liked
        how they could edit the value that you can enter. They liked how you
        could input the specific grams or weight. They described the ability
        to add food record as the best feature of the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were several features that they would like to be improved. They
        would like there to be a description of the add records button. or
        changed to a more descriptive name as they had confusion about it.
        They would of liked there to be a separate area for food records that
        they had entered. They also suggested that there should be categories.
        Showing that they had no knowledge about the pre-existing categories.
        They suggest that the edit button in the daily record would be next to
        the macro nutrient values rather than being visible after clicking the
        dropdown. They also did not like the search they felt it was too
        clustered. They liked the dropdown, however they would have preferred
        there to be just a title of the food. They also wanted a simpler search.
        Perhaps have images on the categories. When the participant searched
        up oats, when they clicked on the one of the options, the first thing
        they saw was the nutritional information, they feel this is not
        relevant to them, as they are not too interested in this much detail.
      </p>
      <h3>Participant 3</h3>
      <p>
        The first feature that participant 3 was confused about when accessing the 
        application was the profile setting because he did not know if the information 
        being entered was useful for the application. Because he did not know if this 
        information was useful, we wanted to skip this step but the application did 
        not let him which was frustrating for him. When presented to the main menu, 
        the participant did not know what the Daily Diet Record option was for and the 
        description did not help him understand what this feature does. Upon adding a 
        food record, the participant realises that the Daily Diet Record was to view the 
        users added Food Record. When the participant was searching for a food record a 
        list of categories were displayed in a text format and upon accidentally clicking 
        on the text he was surprised to see that the text were actually clickable. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The features that participant 3 did not like was the search feature because 
        there was an overwhelming amount of information displayed when searching 
        for an item which makes it hard to find the specific item they want. He also 
        did not like that the clickable text and non-clickable text are identical 
        which cannot be distinguished unless clicked. There was also a lack of 
        instructions that are presented when accessing the application for the first 
        time which makes it hard for the participant to navigate through features 
        and understand what the feature does.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Improvements that participant 3 has suggested includes adding more instructions to 
        help new users to navigate through the application with ease and help them understand
        what each feature does, updating new UI as the current one looks outdated, implementing
        images that can help users to identify what a feature does, and create a customized
        text with a drop down image next to the text that are clickable to distinguish clickable and 
        non-clickable text. 
      </p>
      <h3>Participant 4</h3>
      <p>
        Participant 4 was caught off guard when she opened the application as it 
        immediately asks the user to rate their application when this is the first 
        time using it. Through exploring the application, the participant was 
        confused what the Add Own Food Record menu option was on the main page as 
        she was a new user and doesn't know what Food Records means. Upon using the 
        Add Own Food Record page, the participant realises this page is for users 
        to add their own customized "Food Record" into the food record database. 
        Another feature that the participant was confused about was when the user 
        was searching for a food item we asked her to search and add into her Daily 
        Food Records which was eggs. There was a lot of options that weren't 
        relevant to what the participant wanted when searching for the item egg. 
        The options that were given to her was Scrambled eggs or very specific dishes 
        but she only wanted an egg. The participant then realizes that the searching 
        algorithm isn't as intuitive as she would like it to be when searching for 
        food records. Lastly, the participant was surprised when exploring the consumed 
        nutritional information page as she found a text at the bottom of the screen 
        informing her that the information she has inputted in the profile page was 
        relevant to the consumed nutritional information. This was surprising as an 
        information as important as this was not evidently visible to the user but 
        instead was at the very bottom of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        The participant liked seeing the nutrient information of the food records that 
        they were adding to their Daily Diet Record, but the participant had a hard time 
        understand what the information means as they are not a nutritionist. She also find 
        the option to edit the weight of the food that you have in the Daily Food Record 
        page in case the user accidentally inserted the wrong values. The nature of the 
        application was not invasive which doesn't force the participant to create an account 
        which was what the participant liked the most as she was able to use the application 
        with ease. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The participant believes there is still a lot of room for improvements such as 
        optimizing the searching algorithm to be more intuitive by categorizing the items 
        better in the database, implementing more instructions to help new users to navigate 
        through the application with ease, implementing different serving sizes depending 
        on the item selected, and adding additional information when showing more technical 
        terms to users that are not a nutritionist.
