      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The study method that we chose for this assignment is the usability study. We chose this study because as future 
        software developers we want to understand and learn how usability studies are conducted when releasing a software 
        application in order to receive feedback from users. Through our usability study, we want to find the pros and cons 
        of an application, and if there are any improvements or new features a participant would like to see. Upon collecting 
        our findings, we will be comparing the similarities between the findings of each participant in order to identify 
        the bad features in the application that needs further improvements and possible new features that can be implemented into 
        the application. By conducting this study, we will have sufficent number of usability issues we have found in the application
        and with this information we can inform the developers of this application to improve the applications using the data we have
        provided to them. 
      </p>
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <P>
        Our methodology for the usability testing, was largely based off a paper from Phil Carter (Carter, 2007). In
        this paper Carter outlines a methodology that focusses on exploratory research. Traditional study methods
        such as collecting data from surveys and questionnaire which are usually reflective or a Cognitive Walkthrough
        which is more focussed on the design of the application (Wharton et al, 1994). The issues with these traditional study methodologies
        is that
        the user operates under a framework determined solely determined by the questioners, i.e. the questioners will
        ask them questions and. In a usability test the user will operate
        under their own framework rather than the testers'. Usability testing focusses on inquiring the user's experience
        of an application, while the user is using the application.

        One of the key techniques used in Carter's study methodology, is the <em>Talk aloud</em> or  <em>Think Aloud</em> technique. 
        This technique is a fast-paced technique that involves the participant to voice their thoughts, opinions, confusions while 
        they are using the application. According to Monique W.M. Jaspers et al. (2004), by recording the participant while they 
        interact with the application will allow researchers to further analyses the participant’s behavior through the video recording. 
        By doing so, evaluators can assess the participants reasoning in using the application and find the source of their problems 
        when they are using the system’s interface. The study by Norgaard M. Hornbaek K. (2006), suggests that some cases of using the 
        think aloud testing method might not get sufficiently analyzed. This is because the think aloud method is a fast-paced 
        technique and allow evaluators limited amount of time to note the participant’s reasoning. By video recording the sessions, 
        evaluators will have the ability thoroughly analyze and re-evaluate the participants reasonings of certain problems that’s in 
        the application.

        According to the study by Kaikkonen, A, et el (2005), the number of participants in an ordinary usability test in an iterative development 
        process is often 5 – 10 users per test round. These usability tests are typically done in a laboratory environment because cost and time to 
        conduct field testing is significantly more than one that is conducted in a laboratory environment. As shown in Table 2 that is from the same study, the 
        time to conduct the usability test in a laboratory environment is estimated to be 45 minutes while conducting a usability study using field 
        testing is estimated to be 1 hour and 45 minutes which is almost twice as long as testing in a laboratory setting. The time difference 
        between the two settings are quite significant due to the travel time for test moderators, longer time to set up equipment in a busy area, 
        and the difficulty of a tasks that is being done by the participant. This is interesting because according to this study, field tested participants would 
        move to the side of the pedestrian if a task was confusing in order to focus their concentration to complete the task due to the distractions 
        from the noise around them. Although this increased the testing time, but it did not impact the results of the feedback given from the participant as 
        the feedback recieved from participants that conducted their tests in a laboratory and field are quite similar. Through this study, they were able to 
        conclude that laboratory usability testing  provides sufficent amount of information to improve the user inferface and interaction of a system in 
        comparision to field usability testing.

      <h2>Usability</h2>
      <p>
        The usability study we conducted is on a meal tracking Android application. The purpose of this application is to allow 
        users the ability to record the food that they have eaten during the day, so that they are able to view and track the 
        nutrients that they have consumed for the day. The purpose of this usability study is to identify the flaws within the application 
        that is hard to use (not user friendly), reasonings to these flaws in order to improve it, and future features that can be implemented 
        to enhance the usability of the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        After anaylsing the comparision between Cognitive Walkthrough and Usability Testing from the paper by Phil Carter (2007),
        we have decided to conduct our usability study using usability testing. This is because our study will be a exploratory 
        study where participants will explore and identify various factors within a feature that may have flaws that can be further improved. Because 
        of the nature of our study, we will be collecting qualatative data instead of quantative data such as not using questionnaires 
        by observing the behaviour of our participants while they use the application and not down the reasonings to the problems. <br>
        <b>TALK MORE ABOUT Qualitive data vs Quantitive</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        As suggested by the study by Kaikkonen, A, et el (2005), the typical number of participant in a usability test is often 5 - 10 
        test users. Unfortunately, due to unforseen circumstances we were unable to invite 5 participants but only 4. Although we were unable 
        to meet the suggest number of participants, our participants mainly consists of individuals that have experience in developing software
        which allowed us to recieve constructive feedback regarding bad layout designs and bad implementations in features. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The concerns that we had when planning our usability tests was the amount of influence moderator can impact a participant's user 
        experience and the tools that will allow us to sufficently analyze our data. In order to limit the amount of influence a moderator 
        can impact the participant's user experience, we created rules for the moderator to follow during the testing session. <br>
        <b>TALK MORE ABOUT Carter's moderator rules</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>Carter, no influence to participants. No forcing opinions onto participant that will alter the data.</li>
        <li>Carter, getting confirmation of the problems and issues they are having.</li>
        <li>Carter, never say the participant is wrong </li>
        <li>Carter, listen carefully of the questions are asked for you</li>
        <li>Carter, keep questions simple and intent, no jargon. </li>
        <li>Carter, ask why a lot </li>
        <li>Carter, investigate mistakes </li>
        <li>Carter, probe nonverbal cues, observe their behaviour </li>
        <li>Carter, think aloud</li>
        <li>Carter, not having a commanding tone of moderators towards sessions, friendly tone.</li>
