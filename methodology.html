      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The study method that we chose for this assignment is the usability study. We chose this study because as future 
        software developers we want to understand and learn how usability studies are conducted when releasing a software 
        application in order to receive feedback from users. Through our usability study, we want to find the pros and cons 
        of an application, and if there are any improvements or new features a participant would like to see. Upon collecting 
        our findings, we will be comparing the similarities between the findings of each participant in order to identify 
        the bad features in the application that needs further improvements and possible new features that can be implemented into 
        the application. By conducting this study, we will have sufficent number of usability issues we have found in the application
        and with this information we can inform the developers of this application to improve the applications using the data we have
        provided to them. 
      </p>
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <P>
        Our methodology for the usability testing, was largely based off a paper from Phil Carter (Carter, 2007). In
        this paper Carter outlines a methodology that focusses on exploratory research. Traditional study methods
        such as collecting data from surveys and questionnaire which are usually reflective or a Cognitive Walkthrough
        which is more focussed on the design of the application (Wharton et al, 1994). The issues with these traditional study methodologies
        is that
        the user operates under a framework determined solely determined by the questioners, i.e. the questioners will
        ask them questions and. In a usability test the user will operate
        under their own framework rather than the testers'. Usability testing focusses on inquiring the user's experience
        of an application, while the user is using the application.

        One of the key techniques used in Carter's study methodology, is the <em>Talk aloud</em> or  <em>Think Aloud</em> technique. 
        This technique is a fast-paced technique that involves the participant to voice their thoughts, opinions, confusions while 
        they are using the application. According to Monique W.M. Jaspers et al. (2004), by recording the participant while they 
        interact with the application will allow researchers to further analyses the participant’s behavior through the video recording. 
        By doing so, evaluators can assess the participants reasoning in using the application and find the source of their problems 
        when they are using the system’s interface. The study by Norgaard M. Hornbaek K. (2006), suggests that some cases of using the 
        think aloud testing method might not get sufficiently analyzed. This is because the think aloud method is a fast-paced 
        technique and allow evaluators limited amount of time to note the participant’s reasoning. By video recording the sessions, 
        evaluators will have the ability thoroughly analyze and re-evaluate the participants reasonings of certain problems that’s in 
        the application.

        According to the study by Kaikkonen, A, et el (2005), usability studies are typically done in a laboratory environment because
        the cost and time to conduct field testing is significantly more than one that is conducted in a laboratory environment. There 
        are also a range of variables that can affect the results of the data that is produced such as. Due to these factors as well as
        the unpredictable events of the pandemic, we chose to conduct our
